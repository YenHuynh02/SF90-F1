            <h2>SF90 XX STRADALE</h2>
            <p>
                Ferrari's Special Version cars push the performance of its production models to
                new extremes. Some, such as the 488 Pista and 812 Competizione, have earned a rightful
                place in the Prancing Horse's recent pantheon. Ferrari's 'XX Programme', on the other hand,
                offers a select group of expert client drivers extreme cars that are not homologated for the
                road, to drive on the very limit on the track. One such model is the FXX-K EVO. Ferrari has now
                drawn on these two different spheres of experience to create a Special Version that draws on the
                programme's concepts to make it effectively a road-legal XX: the SF90 XX Stradale.

                    <h1>Headlights</h1>
                    <p>
                        Another signature solution is the headlights which hail a move away
                        from the L-shaped look, to a slender slit design integrated with the brake air
                        intakes resulting in a characteristic C-shape which lends the front of the car
                        an original and futuristic appeal.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In an absolute first for a Ferrari, the SF90 Stradale uses matrix LED headlight
                        technology to improve visibility in all driving conditions thanks to active beam
                        control.

                    <h1>Aeronautical cockpit</h1>
                    <p>
                        More compact overhangs (the rear one is shorter than the front one in particular)
                        and the frontward-shift of the cabin have created a cab-forward-type architecture
                        which emphasises the fact that the engine is mid-mounted. A very low centre of gravity
                        has also allowed the designers to lower the cabin area by 20 mm.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Combined with a more curved windshield, slender A-posts and a wide track, this creates a
                        beautifully proportioned car with sleeker volumes. The compact bubble-shaped cabin has an
                        aeronautical cockpit feel and the fact that it has been shifted so far forward is further
                        emphasised by the geometry of the two body-coloured rear flying buttresses that enclose the
                        rear.

                    <h1>Tail lights</h1>
                    <p>
                        The tail lights have also evolved quite radically from Ferrari's iconic round shape. The
                        eye-catching,
                        more horizontal luminous rings create a more horizontal perception of the tail lights which in
                        turn visually lowers the height of the tail.
